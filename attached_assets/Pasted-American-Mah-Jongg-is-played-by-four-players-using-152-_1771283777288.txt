American Mah Jongg is played by four players using 152 tiles and a unique, annually updated National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) scorecard that dictates winning hands. 
1. Setup and Dealing
The Tiles: The set includes three suits (Dots, Bams, Cracks), plus Winds (North, South, East, West), Dragons, Flowers, and 8 Jokers.
Building the Walls: Each player builds a "wall" in front of their rack, 19 tiles long and 2 tiles high.
The Deal: East (the dealer) rolls dice to break the wall and deals tiles until everyone has 13, except East, who starts with 14. 
2. The Charleston (Tile Exchange)
Unique to American Mah Jongg, this pre-game ritual allows players to trade unwanted tiles: 
First Pass: Pass 3 tiles to the Right, then Across, then Left.
Second Pass: (Optional if all agree) Pass 3 tiles to the Left, then Across, then Right.
Blind Pass: On the final pass of either Charleston, you may "steal" up to 3 tiles from what you receive and pass them on without looking at them.
Courtesy Pass: An optional final trade of 0–3 tiles with the player sitting across from you. 
3. Gameplay and Calling Tiles
Play proceeds counter-clockwise. You either draw a tile from the wall or call the most recently discarded tile. 
Rules for Calling:
You can only call a tile to complete a Pung (3), Kong (4), Quint (5), or Sextet (6).
You cannot call for a single tile or a pair unless it completes your entire Mah Jongg hand.
Once you call a tile, you must "expose" that set on top of your rack.
Jokers: These are wild and can substitute for any tile in a set of 3 or more. If a player has an exposed joker, you can swap it for the real tile if you have it in your hand. 
4. Winning and Scoring
Mah Jongg: To win, you must be the first to collect 14 tiles that exactly match a combination on the current year’s NMJL Scorecard.
Payouts: Points are paid in cash or chips based on the card's value. Picking your own winning tile ("self-draw") or winning with a "jokerless" hand often doubles your payout.
Dead Hands: Your hand is declared "dead" (you stop playing for that round) if you have an incorrect number of tiles or an impossible exposure.
